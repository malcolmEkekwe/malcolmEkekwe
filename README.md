# QA Engineer Portfolio

Welcome to my QA portfolio focused on software testing of the ShopStack e‑commerce application. I specialize in test design, documentation, and defect reporting. Below you'll find links to repositories that showcase my work on test cases, bug reports, regression suites, UAT checklists, and more.

## Key Skills
- Manual test design for web and mobile applications
- Defect reporting with clear reproduction steps and evidence
- Requirements traceability and coverage analysis
- Regression and UAT planning and execution
- Exploratory testing with structured session charters

## Pinned Repositories
- **qa-test-cases** – Manual test cases for core modules of the ShopStack app
- **qa-bug-reports** – Example defect reports with steps to reproduce
- **qa-traceability-matrix** – Linking requirements, test cases, and defects
- **qa-regression-suite** – Regression and smoke test suites for releases
- **qa-uat-checklists** – UAT checklists and acceptance criteria
- **qa-test-reports** – Test execution summaries and defect metrics
- **qa-exploratory-sessions** – Notes from exploratory testing sessions

## Automation

In addition to manual testing artefacts, this portfolio includes a lean set of Playwright tests under the [`qa-playwright-tests`](https://github.com/malcolmEkekwe/qa-playwright-tests) repository. These tests automate smoke and core regression scenarios such as login, searching products, adding items to the cart and completing a checkout. The automation suite is intentionally lightweight for v1 and is designed to grow alongside the manual artefacts. Continuous integration runs the suite across Chromium, Firefox and WebKit, with HTML reports generated for each run.

Feel free to explore each repository to see detailed artifacts and documentation.
