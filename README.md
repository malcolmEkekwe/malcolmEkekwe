# Manual QA Engineer Portfolio

Welcome to my manual QA portfolio focused on software testing of the ShopStack e‑commerce application. I specialize in test design, documentation, and defect reporting. Below you'll find links to repositories that showcase my work on test cases, bug reports, regression suites, UAT checklists, and more.

## Key Skills
- Manual test design for web and mobile applications
- Defect reporting with clear reproduction steps and evidence

- Regression and UAT planning and execution
- Exploratory testing with structured session charters
