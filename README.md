# 👋 Hi there, I'm Malcolm!  

🎯 **Quality Assurance Engineer | Software Tester | Bug Hunter Extraordinaire**

## 🚀 About Me
I’m a **QA Engineer with 5+ years of experience** ensuring that software not only works — but works **flawlessly**.  
From **manual testing** to **test planning** and **bug triage**, I live for uncovering issues before they ever reach the user.  
I believe **quality is not an act, it’s a habit** — and that mindset drives my work every day.
